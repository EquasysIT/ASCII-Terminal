This is a project to create an ASCII terminal which outputs characters direct to a monitor. The resolution is 640 x 480 VGA 64 x 40 characters or 32 x 20 characters. To create a computer to test it, I've added a 65C02 processor, 16K ROM with BBC BASIC and WOZMON and 16K RAM. You can use this to have direct to screen output and PS2 keyboard input. The design is for a Tang Nano 20K board with BeebFPGADock but can easily be adapted to any other FPGA. It also supports keyboard input over UART with settings of 115200,8,N,1. The UART connection runs over the standard USB cable connection to the Tang Nano 20K board. See WIKI for more information.
